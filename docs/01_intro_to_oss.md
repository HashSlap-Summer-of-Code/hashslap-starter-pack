# What is Open Source? 🌟

## 🚀 Welcome to Open Source Software (OSS)!

**What is OSS?**  
Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can view, use, modify, and share. It’s built collaboratively by developers worldwide, powering tools like Linux, Firefox, and VSCode.  
*Think of it as a community cookbook: everyone can see the recipe, tweak it, and share their version!*

**Key Facts**:  
- **Free to Use**: No cost, open to all.  
- **Public Code**: Hosted on platforms like GitHub.  
- **Community-Driven**: Built by contributors like you!
